# Adding Actions to Your Workspace

Actions are the building blocks of your workspace. Each action performs a specific task when you launch your workspace.

## Action Types

### Launch Applications
Open any installed application on your system.

**Tip**: Great for launching your editor, browser, or communication tools.

### Open URLs
Navigate to specific web pages automatically.

**Tip**: Useful for opening dashboards, documentation, or monitoring tools.

### Run Commands
Execute shell commands, PowerShell scripts, or batch files.

**Example**: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Tip**: Start servers, run scripts, or perform custom operations.

### Delays
Add pauses between actions to ensure proper sequencing.

**Tip**: Some applications need time to start before others can connect to them.

## Best Practices

1. **Order matters**: Place dependencies first (e.g., start database before backend)
2. **Use delays**: Add 2-5 second delays between heavy applications
3. **Test incrementally**: Add one action at a time and test
4. **Use variables**: Make paths and URLs dynamic with variables

## Example Configuration

```
1. Launch VS Code → Open project folder
2. Delay → 2 seconds
3. Launch Terminal → Run dev server
4. Delay → 3 seconds
5. Open URL → localhost:3000
```
