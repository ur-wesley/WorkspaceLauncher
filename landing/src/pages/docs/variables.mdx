# Using Variables

Variables make your configurations flexible and reusable. Use them to avoid hardcoding paths, ports, or other values.

## Variable Syntax

Use `${VARIABLE_NAME}` anywhere you need dynamic values.

Example:
```
${PROJECT_ROOT}/backend
${SERVER_PORT}
${API_URL}
```

## Scope Levels

### Workspace Variables
Available to all environments within a workspace.

**Use for**: Shared paths, common ports, team settings

### Environment Variables
Specific to one environment, can override workspace variables.

**Use for**: Developer-specific paths, local ports, personal preferences

## Common Use Cases

### Project Paths
```bash
# Variable
PROJECT_ROOT = C:\Projects\MyApp

# Usage in action
${PROJECT_ROOT}\backend\start.ps1
```

### Dynamic Ports
```
# Variable
BACKEND_PORT = 8080

# Usage
http://localhost:${BACKEND_PORT}/health
```

### Team Collaboration
```bash
# Workspace variable
REPO_URL = https://github.com/team/project

# Everyone uses same URL
git clone ${REPO_URL}
```

## Tips

- **Name clearly**: `API_URL` is better than `URL1`
- **Use defaults**: Set values at workspace level, override only when needed
- **Document**: Add notes about what each variable should contain
