# Workspace Management Tips

Organize multiple workspaces efficiently and maintain them easily.

## Organization Strategies

### By Purpose
- **Development**: Frontend, Backend, Full Stack
- **Gaming**: Single Player, Multiplayer, Stream Setup
- **Server**: Production, Staging, Local Testing

### By Project
- Group all workspaces related to one project
- Use consistent naming: `Project-Dev`, `Project-Prod`

### By Environment
- Separate development and production configurations
- Use tags or colors for visual identification

## Workspace Actions

### Duplicate
Quickly create similar workspaces:
1. Right-click a workspace
2. Select "Duplicate"
3. Rename and modify as needed

**Tip**: Start with a template workspace and duplicate for variations.

### Archive
Hide workspaces you rarely use:
- Move to archive to declutter
- Restore anytime if needed

### Import/Export
Share configurations:
- **Export**: Save workspace as JSON
- **Import**: Load from file or clipboard
- **Share**: Send to team members

## Maintenance

- **Review quarterly**: Delete unused workspaces
- **Update regularly**: Keep paths and versions current
- **Document changes**: Leave notes for future you
