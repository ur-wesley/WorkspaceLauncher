# Best Practices

Expert tips for getting the most out of WorkspaceLauncher.

## Workspace Design

### Start Simple
Begin with 3-5 essential actions. Add complexity gradually.

### Logical Ordering
```
1. Database/Infrastructure first
2. Backend services
3. Frontend applications
4. Monitoring/dashboards
5. Documentation URLs
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Clear**: "Production Server" not "Server 1"
- **Consistent**: Use prefixes across projects
- **Descriptive**: "React Dev with Hot Reload"

## Variable Management

### Use Workspace-Level Variables
Store common values once:
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=${USER}\Projects\App
TEAM_GIT_ORG=https://github.com/myorg
```

### Override When Needed
Environment-specific values:
```bash
# Developer's local path
PROJECT_ROOT=C:\Dev\App
```

### Document Variables
Add comments in workspace notes about what each variable contains.

## Performance

### Add Strategic Delays
```bash
1. Heavy app launch → 3 sec delay
2. Server start → 5 sec delay
3. Quick commands → no delay
```

### Monitor Startup Time
Keep total launch time under 30 seconds when possible.

### Kill Unused Processes
Use the running panel to free resources.

## Collaboration

### Share Templates
Create team template library in version control.

### Document Workflows
Include README files explaining workspace purpose.

### Review Regularly
Team check-ins to update shared configurations.

## Security

### Avoid Sensitive Data
Don't hardcode passwords or API keys in actions.

### Use Environment Variables
Store secrets outside workspace configurations.

### Review Imports
Check imported workspaces before running.

## Maintenance

### Quarterly Cleanup
Remove unused workspaces and old templates.

### Update Regularly
Keep action paths and URLs current.

### Backup Often
Export important workspaces regularly.
