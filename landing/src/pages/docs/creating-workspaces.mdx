# Creating Your First Workspace

A workspace is a collection of actions that you want to run together. Think of it as a blueprint for launching your environment.

## Basic Setup

1. **Click** the "New Workspace" button
2. **Enter** a name (e.g., "Frontend Dev", "Gaming Setup", "Server Management")
3. **Add** a description to remember what this workspace is for
4. **Choose** an icon (optional) for visual identification

## Quick Example

Create a workspace called "React Project" that:
- Opens VS Code in your project folder
- Launches a development server
- Opens the browser to localhost:3000

This saves you from manually running each step every time!

## Tips

- **Use descriptive names**: "AWS Server Prod" is better than "Server 1"
- **Group similar workspaces**: Use prefixes like "Dev-", "Prod-", "Gaming-"
- **Start simple**: Begin with 2-3 actions and add more as needed
