# Process Tracking

Monitor running actions and manage processes effectively.

## Real-Time Monitoring

When you launch a workspace, the **Running Actions** panel shows:

- **Active status**: Which actions are currently running
- **Progress**: Real-time updates on each action
- **Logs**: Output from commands and scripts
- **Errors**: Clear error messages if something fails

## Process Management

### View History
See all past runs:
- Success/failure status
- Execution time
- Timestamps
- Error logs for debugging

### Kill Processes
Stop running actions:
1. Open the running panel
2. Click stop on any action
3. Process terminates cleanly

**Tip**: Always kill processes through WorkspaceLauncher to ensure proper cleanup.

## Troubleshooting

### Process Won't Start
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify applications are installed
- Look for permission issues

### Process Won't Stop
- Use the kill button in the panel
- Check Task Manager if unresponsive
- Restart the application if needed

### Unexpected Behavior
- Review action logs
- Check variable values
- Test commands manually first

**Pro Tip**: Keep the logs panel open while testing new workspaces to catch issues early.
